## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Player Interaction:** 
   - Choose between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking on the respective button.
2. **Computer’s Choice:** 
   - The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. **Winner Determination:** 
   - Based on the classic rules:
     - Rock beats Scissors.
     - Scissors beat Paper.
     - Paper beats Rock.
4. **Score Update:** 
   - The winner's score is incremented, and a message displays the round's result.
5. **Game Over:** 
   - The first to reach 5 points is declared the winner.
   - A reset button appears to start a new game.
